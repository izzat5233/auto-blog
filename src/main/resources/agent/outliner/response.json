      "title": "What is a Thread?",
      "description": "In Java, a thread is a lightweight subprocess that can perform a specific task independently. It is the smallest unit of execution that is scheduled by the operating system.",
      "subsections": []

      "title": "Why Use Multithreading?",
      "description": "Multithreading offers several benefits, including improved performance, better resource utilization, and better user experience.",
      "subsections": []
    },
    {
      "title": "Creating a Thread in Java",
      "description": "In Java, there are two ways to create a thread: by extending the Thread class or by implementing the Runnable interface.",

      "title": "Synchronization",
      "description": "Synchronization is another essential concept in multithreading in Java. It ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time to avoid unexpected results.",

      "title": "Thread States",
      "description": "A thread in Java can exist in several states, including New, Runnable, Blocked, Waiting, Timed Waiting, and Terminated.",
