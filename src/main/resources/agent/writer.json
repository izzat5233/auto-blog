It is the smallest unit of execution that is scheduled by the operating\nsystem.\n\nIn other words, a Java thread is like a worker who is assigned a specific task, such as performing a calculation,\nreading data from a socket, or handling a user input. The thread executes its task independently of other threads, which\nmeans that you can have multiple threads executing different tasks simultaneously in a Java program.\n\nUnderstanding how threads work is crucial for developing high-performance Java applications that can take advantage of\nmodern multi-core CPUs. In this article, we will explore the basics of multithreading in Java and discuss how it can be\nused to write concurrent and efficient programs."
